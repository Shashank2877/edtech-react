# Image Setup Instructions

## Steps to add the professional images to your About page:

1. **Save the attached images** to your `d:\edtech-react\public\` folder with these names:

   - First image (conference/auditorium): `professional-event-1.jpg`
   - Second image (classroom presentation): `professional-event-2.jpg`
   - Third image (award ceremony): `professional-event-3.jpg`

2. **Image names should be exactly:**

   ```
   d:\edtech-react\public\professional-event-1.jpg
   d:\edtech-react\public\professional-event-2.jpg
   d:\edtech-react\public\professional-event-3.jpg
   ```

3. **If images don't load**, they will automatically fallback to `startup-cert.png`
