## Core Concepts

### Supervised Learning
Learn how algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions on new, unseen data. This includes classification and regression problems.

### Unsupervised Learning
Discover patterns in data without labeled examples, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rules.

### Deep Learning
Understand neural networks and how they can solve complex problems like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

## Practical Applications

- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Predictive maintenance
- Customer segmentation
- Automated decision making

## Getting Started

Begin with foundational mathematics, learn Python and key libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow, and practice with real-world datasets.`,
